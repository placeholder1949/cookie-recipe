   <h3> History of cookies </h3> 
    <p>Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie. They are thought to have come around 7 A.D, 
      <br> when common sugar was developed, which helped give the cookies their signiture texture and shape. 
      <br> the word cookie comes from an dutch word that was translated into english </p>
